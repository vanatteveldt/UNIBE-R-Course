# Data Wrangling and Text Analysis in R

Before we start, [please make sure you have RStudio installed and you have played around with R at least a little bit!](https://github.com/ccs-amsterdam/r-course-material/blob/master/tutorials/R_basics_1_getting_started.md)

* Daily routine:

We have two sessions per day. Each session has the following routine:

1. Background reading and introductory video (asynchonous)
2. Interactive Q&A (plenary zoom) 
3. Supervised practice session (zoom breakout rooms)

On Monday, the interactive session starts 10:00. All other days, the interactive sessions will be 10:30 - 12:00 for the morning session and 14:30 - 16:00 for the afternoon session. Please make sure that you have read the background reading, watched the introduction, and played a little bit on your own before that time so you have your questions ready for the Q&A.

* Topics

The table below (will) contain(s) the links to the videos, background reading, and handouts.
